Execute a command by clicking, or navigating with your arrow keys and pressing Enter. Filter commands by typing in the text box at the top of the palette. The palette is organized into categories, and you can filter on a single category by clicking on the category header or by typing the header surrounded by colons in the search input (e.g., <code>:file:</code>).</p>

            <p>You can try these things from the command palette:</p>

Navigate into directories by double-clicking, and use the breadcrumbs at the top to navigate out. Create a new file/directory by clicking the plus icon at the top. Click the middle icon to upload files, and click the last icon to reload the file listing. Drag and drop files to move them to subdirectories. Click on a selected file to rename it. Sort the list by clicking on a column header. Open a file by double-clicking it or dragging it into the main area. Opening an image displays the image. Opening a code file opens a code editor. Opening a notebook opens a very preliminary notebook component.</p>
